# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the game board's structure, creating a 3x3 grid using elements like div or table. CSS styles the appearance, defining the board's layout, colors, and the 'X' and 'O' markers. JavaScript handles the game's logic.
